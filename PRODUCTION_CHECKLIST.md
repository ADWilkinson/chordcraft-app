# ChordCraft Production Deployment Checklist

This checklist will help ensure that your ChordCraft application is ready for production deployment.

## Environment Setup

- [ ] Create a `.env` file in the project root with all required environment variables
- [ ] Create a `.env` file in the `scripts` directory with all required environment variables
- [ ] Create a `service-account.json` file in the `scripts` directory with Firebase Admin credentials
- [ ] Ensure all API keys have appropriate rate limits and security settings

## Production Preparation

- [ ] Run the production preparation scripts in sequence:

```bash
# Run all scripts in the correct order
npm run prod-release
```

Or run them individually:

```bash
# Check Firebase security rules
npm run check-security

# Verify cloud functions are set up correctly
npm run verify-functions

# Optimize application performance
npm run optimize

# Check database integrity and mark low-quality progressions for regeneration
npm run prepare-db

# Final production release preparation
npm run release
```

- [ ] Verify that all low-quality progressions have been marked for regeneration
- [ ] Ensure the database has proper integrity and all required collections exist
- [ ] Verify that all progressions meet quality standards

## Code Quality

- [ ] Run linting on all code files:

```bash
npm run lint
```

- [ ] Fix any linting errors or warnings
- [ ] Run tests to ensure all components are working properly:

```bash
npm test
```

- [ ] Fix any failing tests

## Security

- [ ] Ensure all API keys are stored securely and not committed to the repository
- [ ] Check Firebase security rules to ensure proper data access controls
- [ ] Verify that user authentication is working properly
- [ ] Ensure that sensitive operations are protected by authentication

## Performance

- [ ] Run Lighthouse or similar tool to check performance metrics
- [ ] Optimize any slow-loading components or assets
- [ ] Ensure that the application loads quickly on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify that the application works well on different browsers and devices

## Deployment

- [ ] Build the production version of the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

- [ ] Test the production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

- [ ] Deploy the application to Firebase:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

- [ ] Verify that the deployed application works correctly
- [ ] Check that all Firebase functions are deployed and working

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Monitor the application for any errors or issues
- [ ] Set up logging and error tracking
- [ ] Create a backup of the database
- [ ] Document any known issues or limitations

## Final Checks

- [ ] Test the user flow from start to finish
- [ ] Verify that chord progression generation works correctly
- [ ] Check that the reporting system works properly
- [ ] Ensure that all UI components are responsive and accessible

Once all items on this checklist are complete, your ChordCraft application should be ready for production use!

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues after deployment, have a rollback plan ready:

1. Revert to the previous version of the application:

```bash
firebase hosting:clone <project-id>:live <project-id>:previous
firebase hosting:clone <project-id>:previous <project-id>:live
```

1. Restore the database from backup if necessary.

1. Document the issue and fix it in a development environment before redeploying.

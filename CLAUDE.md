### Backend (Firebase)

The backend is built on Firebase, providing a serverless architecture with the following services:

1. **Firestore Database**
   - Stores chord progressions
   - Manages user favorites
   - Tracks reported progressions

2. **Firebase Authentication**
   - Handles user authentication
   - Manages user sessions

3. **Firebase Hosting**
   - Hosts the web application
   - Provides CDN capabilities

4. **Cloud Functions**
   - Processes AI-generated progressions
   - Handles progression reporting
   - Manages database operations

### External Services

1. **OpenAI Integration**
   - Generates unique chord progressions based on user preferences
   - Provides analysis and musical context
   - Used for seeding the database with high-quality progressions

## Data Models

### Chord Progression

```typescript
interface ChordProgression {
  id: string;
  key: string;
  scale: string;
  mood: string;
  style: string;
  chords: (string | { name: string; notation?: string })[];
  qualityScore?: number;
  isAIGenerated?: boolean;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
}
```

### User Favorites

```typescript
interface UserFavorite {
  userId: string;
  progressionId: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
}
```

### Progression Report

```typescript
interface ProgressionReport {
  progressionId: string;
  reason: string;
  details: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Progression Generation and Retrieval

1. **Random Progression Fetching**
   - Fetches a random progression from Firestore
   - Filters out reported progressions
   - Only includes progressions with quality score >= 70
   - Limits to 20 results and picks one randomly

2. **AI Progression Generation**
   - Uses OpenAI to generate unique progressions
   - Processes the response to extract chord information
   - Formats and stores the progression in Firestore
   - Assigns a quality score based on musical coherence

### Chord Playback System

1. **Audio Generation**
   - Uses the Web Audio API to generate chord sounds
   - Implements proper voice leading between chords
   - Manages audio context and connections

2. **Visualization**
   - Highlights the currently playing chord
   - Provides visual feedback for playback state
   - Shows chord names and numbers

3. **Tempo Control**
   - Allows adjustment of playback speed
   - Maintains timing accuracy between chord changes

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Left/right arrows to navigate between progressions
   - F key to toggle favorites
   - Space to play/pause, R to reset, +/- for tempo

2. **Mobile Experience**
